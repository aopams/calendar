/**
 * This package is our handler package. This package maintains
 * the SparkHandler class that deals with communicating the backend
 * to the frontend. We've also defined enums under the class
 * Commands that act as part of various switch statements
 * to specify what actions are being done on the front end, and
 * how the backend should deal with them. The database handler
 * maintains functions that communicate with the database that
 * our project manages. This package also maintains our ranker which
 * incorporates an algorithm to figure out optimal time slots
 * for an event for a user(s). Our event class acts as an object that
 * stores various fields including duration, date and time, description,
 * attendees, etc.
